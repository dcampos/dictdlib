CLASSES
    DictWriter
    
    class DictWriter
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __init__(self, basename, url='unknown', shortname='unknown', longinfo='unknown', quiet=0)
     |      Initialize a DictWriter object.  Will create 'basename.dict' and
     |      'basename.index' files.  url, shortname, and longinfo specify the
     |      respective attributes of the database.  If quiet is 1,
     |      status messages are not printed.
     |  
     |  finish(self, dosort=1)
     |      Called to finish the writing process.  **REQUIRED**.
     |      This will write the index and close the files.
     |      
     |      dosort is optional and defaults to true.  If set to false,
     |      dictlib will not sort the index file.  In this case, you
     |      MUST manually sort it through "sort -df" before it can be used.
     |      You might want to do this if you have a very large file since
     |      dictdlib's sort algorithm is not very efficient yet.
     |  
     |  update(self, string)
     |      Writes string out, if not quiet.
     |  
     |  writeentry(self, defstr, headwords)
     |      Writes an entry.  defstr holds the content of the definition.
     |      headwords is a list specifying one or more words under which this
     |      definition should be indexed.  This function always adds 
     |      
     |      to the end of defstr.
     |  
     |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     |  Data and non-method functions defined here:
     |  
     |  __doc__ = None
     |  
     |  __module__ = 'dictdlib'
     |      str(object) -> string
     |      
     |      Return a nice string representation of the object.
     |      If the argument is a string, the return value is the same object.

FUNCTIONS
    b64_decode(str)
        Takes as input a string and returns an integer value of it decoded
        with the base64 algorithm used by dict indexes.
    
    b64_encode(val)
        Takes as input an integer val and returns a string of it encoded
        with the base64 algorithm used by dict indexes.
    
    sortnormalize(x)
        Returns a value such that x is mapped to a format that sorts properly
        with standard comparison.

DATA
